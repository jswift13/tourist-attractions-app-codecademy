# 🌸 Tourist Attractions App

A pastel-colors inspired Flask app to log and organize your dream travel destinations!  
Move places between categories, add new spots, and keep track of everywhere you want to go (or have been!) — all in a simple, retro-cute interface.
From the "Build Python Web Apps with Flask" course on Codecademy.
